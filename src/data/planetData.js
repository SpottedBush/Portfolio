        However, this observation is complicated by stellar leakage, which is a thousand to ten thousand times stronger than the disk\'s \
        intensity. It is possible to extract the light from the environment by exploiting the rotational or polarization invariance of \
        stellar leakage, but no existing method jointly leverages both. This is why I made PADI, a method based on the inverse \
        problem approach to disentangle the polarized and unpolarized environmental light from stellar leakage. This led to a publication \
        at the GRETSI 2025 conference.',
